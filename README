This formatter for Cucumber outputs textile, suitable for posting to a GitHub wiki page.

The implementation is quite naive and skips cases like status of steps (passing, failing, pending).
It also does not properly handle table steps because I'm not using them right now and can't
really tell how they work.

It is based on the HTML formatter, so there is almost certainly a more straightforward way
to implement this.

To use:

Save textile_formatter.rb in features/support. Then:

  cucumber features -ftextile
